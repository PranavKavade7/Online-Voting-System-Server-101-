            <p class="text">
                Secret Ballot is a function where individual voter's vote details are not available to anybody, including the election managers and the IT team managing the platform.
                <br/> <br/>
                This ensures the voter can vote without any fear. <br/> <br/>
                This is specifically helpful where election management is in the hands of one of the contestants. <br/> <br/>
                Example: If a dictator of a country is holding a referendum on himself, citizens of that country would be very scared to vote against him. With the assurance of #SecretBallot, voters can vote fearlessly. <br/> <br/>

            <p class="text">
                 Generally each voter is supposed to provide UNIQUE login IDs (Email ID / Mobile Number) in the voter list. <br/> <br/> However, if for some reason, more than one voter is sharing the same Login ID, we have a feature for such situations. <br/> <br/> This feature is very helpful when one person owns more than one flat in a building and he needs to be provided an option to vote for each flat separately.
                 <br/> <br/>

This is also useful in cases where a person has been appointed as proxy by several voters. Another use case is when husband and wife share the same email ID but would like to vote independently. <br/> <br/>

                 In a country like India where many people are not literate and where different sections of people are comfortable with different languages, picture is the only universal language.
           <br/> <br/> <br/>
We provide the option of putting one or two pictures in options for voter to identify their option easily.

            <p class="text">
                 
           Allow vote change feature allows the voter to change his vote anytime before the close of the poll.
         <br/> <br/> 
This feature is very useful where a voter is expected to change his opinion due to happening of certain event. For example, audience of a debate might have different opinion on a subject before the debate and might change their opinion after hearing the debate.

 <br/> <br/>

This feature is also a very useful feature where there is a risk of coercion. If the voter was forced to vote against his wishes, whenever he is in private space, he can change his vote.

            <p class="text">
                 In any important voting, generally the losing party cries foul and blames the system. Hence, its important to provide facility where system can establish the total flow of votes - starting with the voter to the end result to establish that the whole process has been fair.
    
          <br/> <br/>

However, important election also requires secret ballot so that voter is able to vote fearlessly and nobody should be able to know his individual vote.

 <br/> <br/> 

Right2Vote platform has been able to provide these two mutually exclusive function together on this platform with smart use of Aadhaar and Encryption.

            <p class="text">
                  
            Many times in Cooperative Housing Society Elections and Association Elections, a committee needs to be elected.
       <br/> <br/>
The election rule requires voters to select more than one member from the candidate list. Right2Vote is one of the very few eVoting platforms that provides the features of committee election or team election.
       <br/> <br/>
Right2Vote also provides the option of customizing the eVoting to elect "upto X candidates" or "exactly X candidates". IF the "exact 5" option is selected by the election officer, then the voter must select exactly 5 candidates from the list. If he tries to select more than 5 or less than 5, the system will notify him and not allow him to submit his vote until he changes his selection to exactly 5. 
           <br/> <br/>
So if you want to have a voting on which 11 players should be selected in the Indian cricket team for the world cup, use Right2Vote.
